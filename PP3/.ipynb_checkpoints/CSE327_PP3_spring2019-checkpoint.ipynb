    "## Problem 1: Tiny Image Representation + Nearest Neighbor Classifier\n",
    "{25 points} You will start by implementing the tiny image representation and the nearest neighbor classifier. They are easy to understand, easy to implement, and run very quickly for our experimental setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"tiny image\" feature is one of the simplest possible image representations. One simply resizes each image to a small, fixed resolution. You are required to **resize the image to 16x16**. It works slightly better if the tiny image is made to have zero mean and unit length (normalization). This is not a particularly good representation, because it discards all of the high frequency image content and is not especially invariant to spatial or brightness shifts. We are using tiny images simply as a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nearest neighbor classifier is equally simple to understand. When tasked with classifying a test feature into a particular category, one simply finds the \"nearest\" training example (L2 distance is a sufficient metric) and assigns the label of that nearest training example to the test example. The nearest neighbor classifier has many desirable features â€” it requires no training, it can learn arbitrarily complex decision boundaries, and it trivially supports multiclass problems. It is quite vulnerable to training noise, though, which can be alleviated by voting based on the K nearest neighbors (but you are not required to do so). Nearest neighbor classifiers also suffer as the feature dimensionality increases, because the classifier has no mechanism to learn which dimensions are irrelevant for the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Report your classification accuracy on the test sets and time consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "- Use [cv2.resize()](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/geometric_transformations.html#resize) to resize the images;\n",
    "- Use [NearestNeighbors in Sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html) as your nearest neighbor classifier."

    "move on to a more sophisticated image representation â€” bags of quantized SIFT\n",
    "features. Before we can represent our training and testing images as bag of\n",

    "will form this vocabulary by sampling many local features from our training set\n",
    "(10's or 100's of thousands) and then cluster them with k-means. The number of\n",
    "k-means clusters is the size of our vocabulary and the size of our features. For\n",
    "example, you might start by clustering many SIFT descriptors into k=50 clusters.\n",
    "This partitions the continuous, 128 dimensional SIFT feature space into 50\n",
    "regions. For any new SIFT feature we observe, we can figure out which region it\n",

    "The last task is to train one-vs-all linear SVMS to operate in the bag of SIFT\n",
    "feature space. Linear classifiers are one of the simplest possible learning\n",
    "models. The feature space is partitioned by a learned hyperplane and test cases\n",
    "are categorized based on which side of that hyperplane they fall on. Despite\n",
    "this model being far less expressive than the nearest neighbor classifier, it\n",
    "will often perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not have to implement the support vector machine. However, linear\n",
    "classifiers are inherently binary and we have a 15-way classification problem\n",
    "(the library has handled it for you). To decide which of 15 categories a test\n",
    "case belongs to, you will train 15 binary, one-vs-all SVMs. One-vs-all means\n",
    "that each classifier will be trained to recognize 'forest' vs 'non-forest',\n",
    "'kitchen' vs 'non-kitchen', etc. All 15 classifiers will be evaluated on each\n",
    "test case and the classifier which is most confidently positive \"wins\". E.g. if\n",
    "the 'kitchen' classifier returns a score of -0.2 (where 0 is on the decision\n",
    "boundary), and the 'forest' classifier returns a score of -0.3, and all of the\n",
    "other classifiers are even more negative, the test case would be classified as a\n",
    "kitchen even though none of the classifiers put the test case on the positive\n",
    "side of the decision boundary. When learning an SVM, you have a free parameter\n",
    "$\\lambda$ (lambda) which controls how strongly regularized the model is. Your\n",
